# frameworks-theory

**An experimental research project developing a foundational theory of frameworks — the structures through which the human mind constructs and engages with reality.**

---

## Introduction
This repository is dedicated to the study of **frameworks** as fundamental structures through which the human mind perceives, interprets, and constructs reality.  
Unlike approaches that dissect material existence directly, this project focuses on the **cognitive and conceptual structures** that mediate our interaction with the world.  

---

## Purpose
- To clarify and formalize the concept of **frameworks**.  
- To develop a **foundational theory** of how frameworks operate across different domains (language, perception, social interaction, physical structures, etc.).  
- To investigate the role of frameworks in the **construction of reality** by the mind.  

---

## Scope
This research explores frameworks in a **conceptual and theoretical sense**, including but not limited to:  
- Cognitive and linguistic frameworks  
- Social and cultural frameworks  
- Structural and material analogies (e.g., architectural frames)  
- Meta-frameworks (frameworks of frameworks)  

The project is ongoing, exploratory, and subject to refinement as new insights emerge.  

---

## Methodology
- **Conceptual analysis**: Identifying recurring patterns of frameworks across different contexts.  
- **Comparative study**: Drawing analogies between physical, linguistic, and social frameworks.  
- **Theoretical synthesis**: Developing unifying principles that explain frameworks as interfaces between mind and reality.

## Repository Structure
- `/notes` – Working notes, drafts, and reflections.  
- `/theory` – Formalized theoretical writing (essays, models, diagrams).  
- `/references` – Relevant literature, sources, and inspirations.  
- `/experiments` – Conceptual or practical explorations of framework applications.  

---

## Status
This is a **nascent, experimental project**. Ideas are subject to revision and reformulation as the research develops.

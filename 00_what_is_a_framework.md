# 00. What is a Framework?

A **framework** is a foundational structure of cognition through which reality is perceived, interpreted, and actively constructed. It is the conceptual scaffolding that shapes and organizes raw experience into a coherent worldview.

Frameworks function as the interface between the mind and the world. They are not reality itself, but the lenses through which reality is filtered and made meaningful. We engage with the world not directly, but through the mediation of these cognitive, linguistic, and cultural structures.

Every framework is inherently dualistic: it both **enables** and **constrains**. By providing a system for understanding, it opens up avenues of thought and interaction. Simultaneously, it imposes limits, defining the boundaries of what is considered possible, logical, or even perceivable within its context.

Often, these frameworks are transparent to the individual. We operate within them unconsciously, taking their assumptions and rules for granted, much like we use the rules of grammar without consciously reciting them. To become aware of a framework is to move from simply using it to analyzing the structure of one's own perception.

In essence, frameworks are the silent architects of our experienced reality.
